- 👋 Hi, I’m @jam3990
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about coding to eventually get into a coding career as a Back End.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything from the beginning through The Odin Project. AKA, I know nothing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever anyone would like. The more exposure, the better.
- 📫 How to reach me: audreypatterson09@gmail.com
